# KNN & Logistic Regression Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer types (benign or malignant) using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. The analysis is performed using both Python and RapidMiner.

## Objective
To develop predictive models using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Logistic Regression techniques for classifying breast cancer cases. The aim is to accurately predict the type of cancer based on physiological characteristics.

## Data
The WDBC dataset consists of 569 instances, each with 32 attributes including ID, diagnosis, and 30 real-valued input features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset by reporting summary statistics and a correlation matrix.
2. **Model Building**: Implement k-NN (k=3) and Logistic Regression models.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare models based on confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.

## Assignment Tasks
1. Load and explore the WDBC dataset.
2. Perform predictive modeling using k-NN and Logistic Regression.
3. Compare and discuss the generalization performance of both models.

## Deliverables
- Python code implementing the models and analysis.
- RapidMiner workflows and results screenshots.
- A detailed report on model performance and insights.
