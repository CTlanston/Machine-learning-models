# Customer Churn Analysis using Decision Trees

## Project Overview
This project, titled "Customer Churn Analysis using Decision Trees," is a part of the HW1 dataset assignment in the MSBA program. It involves applying decision tree classification to understand and predict customer churn.

## Objective
The main goal is to analyze customer churn using decision tree models in both Python and RapidMiner, focusing on identifying key factors influencing customers' decisions to discontinue service.

## Data
The analysis is based on the HW1 dataset, which includes customer demographics, service usage patterns, revenue details, and churn status.

## Methodology
1. **Decision Tree Construction in Python**: Create a decision tree model using entropy, testing different depths.
2. **RapidMiner Modeling**: Duplicate the analysis in RapidMiner for comparison.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and error rate.

## Tasks
1. Build and fine-tune the decision tree in Python.
2. Implement and evaluate the model in RapidMiner.
3. Comprehensive reporting on findings and model performance.

## Deliverables
- Python notebook for decision tree analysis.
- RapidMiner project files and results.
- Detailed report on methodology, analysis, and insights.
