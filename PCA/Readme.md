# README.md for Image Analysis and Reconstruction using PCA

## Project Overview
The project involves using Principle Components Decomposition (PCA) for image analysis and reconstruction. It focuses on a dataset of grayscale images of faces, standardized in terms of orientation and scale.

## Objective
To apply PCA for reducing the dimensionality of image data, reconstructing images with lower-dimensional representations, and exploring concepts like eigenfaces.

## Data
- Dataset: SelfieImageData.csv, containing grayscale image data.
- Each image: 451x451 pixels, with pixel values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

## Methodology
1. **PCA Implementation**: Use PCA to decompose the images and identify principal components (eigenfaces).
2. **Image Reconstruction**: Reconstruct images based on a reduced number of dimensions.
3. **Analysis**: Explore the significance of different principal components in capturing facial features.

## Tasks
1. Develop PCA models for image analysis.
2. Reconstruct images using reduced dimensions.
3. Analyze the impact of dimension reduction on image quality.

## Deliverables
- R script for PCA and image reconstruction.
- Reconstructed images and eigenface plots.
- A report detailing PCA implementation, image reconstruction processes, and findings.
  
## Data Source:
- the Data are relate to different student's face, so here won't post
