# README.md for WDBC Analysis - k-NN, Logistic Regression, and ROC Curves

## Project Overview
This project, titled "WDBC Analysis using k-NN, Logistic Regression, and ROC Curves," is part of the HW3 MSBA Part 2. It involves advanced predictive modeling techniques on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.

## Objective
To optimize and evaluate predictive models, including k-NN, decision trees, and logistic regression, focusing on metrics like the F1-score and ROC curves.

## Data
The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, consisting of 569 instances with 30 feature variables each.

## Methodology
1. **Optimization of Classifiers**: Fine-tune k-NN, decision trees, and logistic regression models.
2. **Nested Cross-Validation**: Implement nested cross-validation for model evaluation.
3. **ROC Curve Analysis**: Compare models using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
4. **F1-Score Assessment**: Focus on optimizing models for the highest F1-score.

## Assignment Tasks
1. Build and optimize classifiers in Python.
2. Analyze and interpret ROC curves and F1-scores.
3. Implement nested cross-validation for robust model assessment.

## Deliverables
- Python notebook for model optimization and evaluation.
- Comprehensive report detailing methodology, results, and insights.
