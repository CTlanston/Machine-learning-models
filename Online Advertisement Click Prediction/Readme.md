# README.md for Online Advertisement Click Prediction using Logistic Regression and Log-Loss Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of online advertisement clicks. It involves a comprehensive approach using logistic regression, with an emphasis on minimizing the log-loss metric to improve prediction accuracy.

## Objective
Develop a model to estimate the probability of ad clicks using logistic regression, effectively handling a large dataset to provide accurate predictions.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset from an online advertising campaign, containing over 30 million records with 24 variables, including ad identifiers, site and app information, device details, and user response.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Extensive data cleaning and preparation to ensure quality inputs for the model.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Implement logistic regression to predict ad clicks.
3. **Log-Loss Evaluation**: Focus on minimizing log-loss for model evaluation, ensuring accurate probability estimates.

## Deliverables
- A Python notebook (code.ipynb) containing the logistic regression implementation and log-loss evaluation.
- A detailed project description outlining the methodology and insights.
- Predicted probabilities of ad clicks, documented in a CSV file.
