# README.md for Model Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project, "Model Evaluation," involves the application and evaluation of various machine learning models for business analytics purposes.

## Objective
To apply, compare, and evaluate different machine learning models to identify the most effective techniques for specific business analytics tasks.

## Methodology
1. **Model Application**: Implement a range of machine learning models.
2. **Overfitting Evaluation**: employ serveral skills to determine wheather the model are over fittign
   - Learning Curves
   - Fitting Graphs
   - Roc Graphs
3. **Hyper Parameter Tuning**: use serveral skills to do hyper parameter tuning
   - Grid Search 
   - Grid Search and Nested Cross-Validation

4. **Data Sampling**: dealing with class imbalance
   - Oversampling
   - Undersampling

## Deliverables
- A Python notebook detailing the application and evaluation of the models.
