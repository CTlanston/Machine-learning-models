# README.md for Consumer Spending Prediction using Linear Regression, k-NN, and Regression Trees

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting consumer spending using advanced predictive modeling techniques, specifically linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and regression trees.

## Objective
To accurately predict consumer spending based on a dataset containing responses to catalog test mailings, leveraging various predictive models and techniques.

## Data
The dataset includes consumer response data to catalog test mailings, with key attributes influencing spending.

## Methodology
1. **Model Implementation**: Develop models using linear regression, k-NN, and regression trees.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create and integrate new features to improve model accuracy.
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for enhanced performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Employ 10-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness and accuracy.

## Deliverables
- Python notebook with implementation and analysis of the models.
- Comprehensive report detailing the model development, feature engineering, and evaluation results.
