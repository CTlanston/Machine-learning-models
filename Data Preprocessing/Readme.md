# README.md  Data Preprocessing Techniques

## Project Overview
This project "Data Preprocessing Techniques," focuses on the application of various data preprocessing methods critical in the field of business analytics.

## Objective
To demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of data preprocessing in preparing datasets for advanced analytics and machine learning applications.

## Methodology
1. **Missing Data**:
   - Eliminating samples or features with missing data
   - Imputing missing values (with Mean / Mode)
2. **Categorical Data**:
   - dictionary-mapping (LabelEncoder class)
   - sparse inputs (OneHotEncoder and sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher)
3. **Feature Selection**:
   - L1-based feature selection
   - Sequential feature selection (Backward / Forward Selection)
   - Recursive feature elimination
4. **Hading Text Feature**:
   - Word counts encoding
## Deliverables
- A Python script containing the preprocessing techniques and methodologies.
- A comprehensive report detailing the preprocessing steps, their importance, and the impact on subsequent analytics.
