# README.md for Credit Scoring Enhancement using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and k-NN

## Project Overview
This project involves enhancing traditional credit scoring methods by implementing advanced machine learning models. The focus is on using decision trees, logistic regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for predictive analysis.

## Objective
To improve the accuracy and efficiency of credit scoring by integrating machine learning techniques into the credit evaluation process.

## Data
The Bank Credit-related Information Dataset contains records of 12,500 customers, providing comprehensive data for each customer including income, account information, loan repayment behaviors, and credit scores.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand key features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data, engineer features, and transform target variables for model compatibility.
3. **Model Implementation**: Experiment with decision trees, logistic regression, and k-NN.
4. **Nested Cross-Validation**: Use for hyperparameter tuning with a focus on F1 score as the metric.

## Deliverables
- Python notebook with detailed analysis and model implementation.
- Comprehensive report on model performance, data preprocessing strategies, and insights gained from the analysis.
