# README.md for k-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
The "k-Means Clustering" project applies k-means clustering for business analytics, focusing on segmenting data into meaningful groups.

## Objective
To demonstrate the effectiveness of k-means clustering in uncovering hidden patterns and segmentations within business-related datasets.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for clustering, including normalization and feature selection.
2. **k-Means Clustering**: Apply k-means clustering to segment the data.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Evaluate and interpret the resulting clusters, focusing on their characteristics and business implications.

## Deliverables
- A Python notebook implementing k-means clustering and analyzing the results.
- A detailed report that includes cluster interpretations and potential business applications.
